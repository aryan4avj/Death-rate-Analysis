Analysis of Death-rate of India and its neighbouring countries, it includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Maldives. As I have data from 1960 to 2018, but here I am analysing data from 2008 - 2018.

Research Questions:

2. Which Country has improved their death rate fastest and what can be the reason for it?
